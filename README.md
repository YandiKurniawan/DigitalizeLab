# DigitalizeLab
this is my final project as a student in politeknik negeri bandung, i make an integrated flutter app with nodeMCU that is located in my college laboratory, 
the function of this app is to open and lend the room and laboratory equipment, and a lab technician can observe on whats going on in the lab, 
all connected to firebase as a database

dont change anything regarding to the database
